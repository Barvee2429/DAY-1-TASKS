HTTP 1
It works on the textual format.
It works on the binary framing layer, converts all the messages to binary format.
There is a persistent connection established between the server request and responses.
All the requests and responses are merged in to a single connection.	
It works on multiplexing and one TCP connection is used for multiple requests.

HTTP 2
It compresses the data by itself for speedup the process.
It uses HTTP packets for compression,
Major drawback will be client cannot separate the resource and the document	It uses PUSH_PROMISE,
Server push is client control
