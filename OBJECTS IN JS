OBJECTS:

Objects are the important datatypes in javascript.
These are different than primitive datatypes,
primitve datatypes can hold one value but objects can hold many values in the form of key:value Pair
These keys can be variables or functions and called properties and methods in the context of the object.

REPRESENTATION :
Objectname.Objectproperty = propertyvalue
example:
//var myName = new object();
